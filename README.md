> This library is on the unstable version v0.X.X, which means there is a chance that any minor update may introduce a breaking change. Where I will endeavor to avoid this, care should be taken updating your dependency on this library until the first stable release v1.0.0 at which point any future breaking changes will result in a new major release.
